		<div class="smalldiv" id="sdiv1">Chicken</div>
  	<p>Famed Chef Jacques Pepin once said, “When you are at home, even if the chicken is a little burnt, what’s the big deal? Relax.” Here’s what I’d like to know: what if the chicken is also a little pale, sawdusty and tastes like sadness? What do you do then? There is only so much wine.</p>

    <div class="smalldiv" id="sdiv2">Beef</div>
  	<p>My mother knows a thing or two about cooking beef. She knows all of the cuts and the best way to prepare them. Perhaps it’s because she came of cooking age during a time when most neighborhoods still had local butchers who prepared the cuts themselves and freely shared information with customers about what to do with them.

  	<p>Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some common varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients and many are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Popular garnishes are often made using daikon.</p>
